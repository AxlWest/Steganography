# Steganography

Steganography is a final year project for my BSc computer games development

This program will use steganography to hide text within images
This has many uses such as hiding enemy data within their textures

The program is fully operational

This program is cross platform
(currently tested and confirmed working on:
	Windows 7
	Windows 10
	fedora (Linux)
)
